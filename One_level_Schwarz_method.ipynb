The additive Schwarz method is used as a preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods. Here, we employ ASM as a preconditioner for the Conjugate Gradient method and examine its impact on convergence. The results illustrate the effectiveness of one–level ASM and limitation in propagating global information, motivating the use of two–level methods."
